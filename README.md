# NoCap
A parametric circular MX keycap designed for 3D printing. Based on [Fake1](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4917086) keycaps.

This keycap uses a rectangular stem shaft which is much easier to print on FDM printers even with a 0.4mm nozzle. It is parametric so you may adjust the tolerances for your own specific printer, or adjust the size, top edge fillet, etc.

To tweak the parameters of this keycap, you will need to install [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/downloads.html#snapshots) (development snapshot recommended) and [BOSL](https://github.com/revarbat/BOSL). You can then open the .scad file in OpenSCAD, modify the parameters at the top as needed, render, and export as STL.
