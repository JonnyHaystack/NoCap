# NoCap
A parametric circular MX keycap optimised for FDM 3D printing. Based on [Fake1](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4917086) keycaps.

This keycap uses a rectangular stem shaft which is much easier to print on FDM printers even with a 0.4mm nozzle. It is parametric so you may adjust the tolerances for your own specific printer, or adjust the size, top edge fillet, etc.

To tweak the parameters of this model, you will need to install a recent development build of [CQ-Editor](https://github.com/CadQuery/CQ-editor#development-packages). You can then open the `NoCap.py` file in CQ-Editor, modify the parameters at the top of the file as needed, then click Render, click on the model preview to select it, and click Tools -> Export as STL.

A STEP file is also included for those who would prefer to edit the model using their CAD package of choice.
